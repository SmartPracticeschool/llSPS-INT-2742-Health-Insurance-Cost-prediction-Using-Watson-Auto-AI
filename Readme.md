# llSPS-INT-2742-Health-Insurance-Cost-prediction-Using-Watson-Auto-AI
The main aim of this project is to create a model based on statistically significant factors (independent variable) which will affect premiums charges (dependent variable) by an insurance company. In this project we are using Multi Linear regression for the accurate prediction. An application is also build in Auto AI Service in IBM Cloud which can be interlinked with the model so as to view the result on UI based on input parameters
